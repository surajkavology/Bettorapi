                        another company.</li>
                    <li>* With Affiliates: We may share Your information with Our affiliates, in

                        Affiliates include Our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint
                        venture partners or other companies that We control or that are under
                        common control with Us.</li>
                    <li>* With business partners: We may share Your information with Our business
                        partners to offer You certain products, services or promotions.</li>

                        Service, Your contacts on the Third-Party Social Media Service may see

                <h4>Retention of Your Personal Data</h4>
                <p>The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary
                    for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your
                    Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations
                    (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable
                    laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
                <p>The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage
                    Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data
                    is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of Our
                    Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time
                    periods.</p>
                <h4>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h4>
                <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company&#39;s
                    operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the
                    processing are located. It means that this information may be transferred to —
                    and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country
                    or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ
                    than those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such
                    information represents Your agreement to that transfer.</p>
                <p>The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data
                    is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer
                    of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless
                    there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and
                    other personal information.</p>
                <h4>Delete Your Personal Data</h4>
                <p>You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the
                    Personal Data that We have collected about You.</p>

                    from within the Service.</p>
                    <p>You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to
                        Your Account, if you have one, and visiting the account settings section that
                        allows you to manage Your personal information. You may also contact Us to
                        request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that You have
                        provided to Us.</p>
                        <p>Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we
                            have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.</p>
                            <p>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</p>
                            <h4>Business Transactions</h4>
                    <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your
                        Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal
                        Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
                        <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your
                            Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by
                            public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
                            <h4>Other legal requirements</h4>
                            <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such
                                action is necessary to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>* Comply with a legal obligation</li>
                                    <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
                                    <li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
                                    <li>* Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
                                    <li>* Protect against legal liability</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Security of Your Personal Data</h4>
                                <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no
                                    method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is
                                    100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
                                    Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                                    <h4>Children&#39;s Privacy</h4>
                                    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
                                        collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
                                        If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided
                                        Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have
                                        collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification
                                        of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our
                                        servers.</p>
                                        <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information
                                            and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent&#39;s
                                            consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
